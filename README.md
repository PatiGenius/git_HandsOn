# git_HandsOn

The script seqClasse.py allows us to classify a sequence as DNA or RNA depending on the bases found in the sequence. When "T" base is found, the program returns a message advising us that the sequence is DNA. When "U" base is found, we are facing a RNA sequence. 
If none of the bases is found (A,C,G,T-U) in the sequence, then we conclude we are not facing a DNA sequence neither a RNA one.
At the same time, we can also look for a motif in the sequence and see if a match is returned or not.
